If you change the name of 'game2lib.py', the game will break.
The custom functions for this game are stored in here:
This means that game needs to read from 'game2lib.py' in order to work.

Thank you so much, and enjoy playing!

-- GUIDE --

: Attacking :
- Attacking is simple. You choose it and you deal a random amount of damage within a predetermined range.
-  Defending is also simple. You choose it and your defence goes up. It's a bit broken, but not really.
-  The item list can be accessed, but does nothing. Maybe at a later date.
-  Passing. Luigi is with you on this one.

Health: 608

-- KNOWN BUGS -- 
-  Passing, defending, or simply having high luck can give absurdly high stats
-  High defence doesn't negate damage properly
-  Speed is way too overpowered
- The item menu does nothing
	- If the game gets expanded or moved to Gamemaker Studio, this might be implemented. Might.
- The stats menu eats your turn. 
	- Yeah I just couldn't figure this one out, sorry.
- Typing a non integer (a number without letters) during your turn crashes the game
	- This means that, if you aren't using an IDE to run the game, the window will close instantly. Your game isn't corrupted.<br/>
